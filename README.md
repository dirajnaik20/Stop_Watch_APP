# Stop_Watch APP

The stopwatch is basically a timepiece that is designed particularly to measure the time elapsed between the activation and deactivation of the stopwatch. The users can start the Stopwatch and stop it anytime. It was originally invented by Samuel Watson. There is also a button to restart the stopwatch that will set the stopwatch to starting. So our task is to make an application for Stopwatch which can be used whenever required.

# Contains
a. Start Button: The start is the activation for the Stopwatch. It will activate the Stopwatch as soon as pressed.

b. Stop Button: The Stop button will be used to deactivate the stopwatch. As soon as we click the stop button the stopwatch will be deactivated. After getting deactivated it will show the total time elapsed between the activation and deactivation of the watch.

c. Reset Button: The reset button is used to set the stopwatch to 00:00:00 again. Stopwatch needs to be reset once its use is done.

# Requirements
1. Java Programming: Java Programming plays an important role in Android app development as it makes the application function and manages it.

2. XML: Extensible Markup Language is useful as it helps us create the user interface for the application. Knowing the basics of it will help you as

3. Android Studio: Android Studio is the platform that we will use for the development of our project. This makes it important for the users to know about the IDE they work on.
